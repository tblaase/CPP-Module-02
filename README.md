# CPP-Module-02

My solution for CPP Module 02 of the Common core of 42 school.

The Scope of this Modul was to get to know C++ further and come in contact with classes in orthodox canonical form:
- ex00: class that can store a fixed point variable
- ex01: add constructors and functions to that class from ex00 to make it usable
- ex02: add all kinds of operator overloads to expand the usability of ex01 even more
- ex03: a use case which uses most of the previously written code by creating a function that can determine weither a point is inside a triangle or not


All of those exercises are compilable with the `-std=c++98`-flag, since this was a requirement for this project.<br>
All exercises where compiled and tested on `macOS Catalina 10.15.7` and `Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS`.


All exercises can be compiled from the root of the exercise with `make`, `make all` or `make re`.<br>
All exercises have a main function to demonstrate all the abilities of the subject.<br>
After that, run the created executable like `./executable_to_run` (ie. ex00 `./fixed`).<br>
